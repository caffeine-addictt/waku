# Announcing Waku v0.7

Some very exciting changes have been made to Waku.

- **new**: Waku's official template now uses [`YAML`](../../configuration/introduction.md)
  for configuration.
- **changed**: The `--repo` flag has been deprecated in favor of the `--source` flag
  for the `waku new` command.

As usual, bug fixes, dependency updates, housekeeping, and documentation updates
are included in this release as well.
