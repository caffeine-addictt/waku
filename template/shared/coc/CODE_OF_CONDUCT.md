# No-Nonsense Code of Conduct

## 1. Stay On Topic

- This space is for technical discussions only.
- Keep all conversations relevant to the project.
- Off-topic chatter, personal opinions, or social discussions belong elsewhere.

## 2. Be Precise & Concise

- No vague questions. Do your research first.
- No unnecessary verbosity. Get to the point.
- Reference official documentation when applicable.

## 3. Keep it Technical

- Critique ideas, not people.
- There’s rarely a single “correct” answer—trade-offs exist. Respect different solutions.
- If you challenge something, provide reasoning or references.
- Expect a strong level of self-sufficiency—this is a collaborative space, not a place for excessive guidance.

## 4. No Drama, No Politics, No Ego

- No personal attacks, ideological debates, or emotional outbursts.
- If a discussion becomes unproductive, move on.

## 5. Contributions Must Add Value

- Feature requests must be justified with clear use cases.
- Bug reports must include reproducible steps and logs.
- PRs must follow contribution guidelines and solve real problems.

## 6. Rule Enforcement

- Violations result in warnings, bans, or PR rejections—decided at maintainers’ discretion.
- This is a technical space. If that’s an issue, this isn’t for you.

## 7. Scope

The No-Nonsense Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces,
including repositories, issues, discussions, and community channels.

Maintainers have final authority on enforcement.
